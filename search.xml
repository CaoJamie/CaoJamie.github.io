    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Set Up Your Github Blogs with HexoIntroductionBasically github provided the personal pages which can host static webpage, and this is exactly the reason why I would try on the it.With the reachability of github you can deploy your personal blog as easy as possible. But the defualt Jekyll Freamework is not really my taste, that is the reason why I choose to use Hexo instead(Also the point that Next is such a beautiful and mature themes) Step 1: Create Your Personal Website RepoGithub Pages provided the service based on github repo. In order to let github recongize that this is the personal website you are going to host, you need to create a repo with exactly the name: Usernam.github.io This will make sure that github recongized your repo as a host for website. Failure to do so may leads to diminished effort because you need to redo the lateral step for the correct version of the repo all again. After that you make sure that the repo name is correct, we can continue onto the installation of hexo. Step 2: Install Hexo on Your ComputerHexo is a framework based on node.js, therefore the node.js is a neccesarity to install. You can either follow the instruction on their website containging the Download Page, or simply do this if you install Anaconda:1conda install -c conda-forge nodejs Notice that you still need to install Hexo after install node.js by doing the following: 1npm install hexo-cli -g Step 3: Set Up the SSH Key for commitGithub provid security measure to make sure that everytime you commit, it is verifed that you are the correct person. This require the long pain process on adding password and user acount everytime, which we are not going to do. Instead, we would establish something called SSH Key that contains a private and a public key to matched together.(Never give anyone your private key!) Actually, you may want to check if you already install the git tools on your computer. If not, go to their website and follow the instructions.]]></content>
